# C++ CMake VSCode Skeleton Project

This repository aims to provide a very bare bones starting point for setting up a C++ project for VSCode.

## Contents

* a devContainer configuration for VSCode's devContainer feature
* CMake files which declare 2 build targets: `prog` and `test` - feel free to extend these as you see fit
* a Github CI/CD pipeline which builds `prog` and runs `test`
